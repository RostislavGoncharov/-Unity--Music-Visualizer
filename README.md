# -Unity--Music-Visualizer

A scene which plays an audio file and modifies various parameters (such as light intensity, object movement speed and post-processing effects) based on the file's contents.

The scene comes with an audio file but you can choose any other .mp3, .wav or .flac file from your drive. Press ESC while the audio is playing to reset the scene.

Made in Unity Engine using the Aura 2 package for volumetric lighting.

The included audio file is an original recording produced by me.
